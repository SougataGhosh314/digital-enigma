Enigma

The Enigma machine was a field unit used in World War II by German field agents to encrypt
and decrypt messages and communications. Similar to the Feistel function of the 1970s, 
the Enigma machine was one of the first mechanized methods of encrypting text using an 
iterative cipher. It employed a series of rotors that, with some electricity, a light bulb, 
and a reflector, allowed the operator to either encrypt or decrypt a message. The original position 
of the rotors, set with each encryption and based on a prearranged pattern that in turn was based 
on the calendar, allowed the machine to be used even if it was compromised.

When the Enigma was in use, with each subsequent key press, the rotors would change in 
alignment from their set positions in such a way that a different letter was produced each time. 
With a message in hand, the operator would enter each character into the machine by pressing 
a typewriter-like key. The rotors would align and a letter would then illuminate, telling the 
operator what the letter really was. Likewise, when enciphering, the operator would press the 
key and the illuminated letter would be the cipher text. The continually changing internal flow 
of electricity that caused the rotors to change was not random, but it created a polyalphabetic 
cipher that could be different each time it was used.

This is a digital redesign of Enigma device: 
design: 3 from a set of five rotors, one reflector, one plugboard with 10 connections

This project was created merely for learning and having fun while doing it, and nothing else.
